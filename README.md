# Reactive Foo
This is a Sample implementation of the Spring Reactive API (Spring 5)

To run the application, you need to build the application as follows:

```bash
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
```

This will run the application from the Command line. It will launch, by default, on port 8080.

To show the stream in action, Use `CURL` from the command line as follows:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/foos
```
